# forgings_calculator
This is my first primitive and single-file program that I wrote in the C++ programming language, using its basics, and first published on github.

This program is designed to calculate the cost of so-called forgings, for example, made of steel, which are semi-finished products that can be turned into a ready-to-use part by complete machining.

What prompted me to create this program? In my main job, I am a sales manager of rolled metal products, which are produced by the plant's workshops. Part of my job is to calculate the cost of products, which I then write down in the commercial offer for the customer. I do all the calculations manually on paper and with a regular calculator. I decided to try to practice using the basics of the C++ programming language I had learned, and try to create at least a program that would speed up my calculations.

I have provided all the source code of the program with comments, so that you will understand everything that happens in the code. I wrote this program not for further use, but to train programming skills, but if you want, you can copy and modify its source code as you like to develop it further.
